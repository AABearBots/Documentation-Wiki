# Introduction

Advanced Algos is a startup developing the AA Platform and hosting trading bots competitions.

The AA Platform provides the environment to develop bots, and once bots are ready to go live, runs them in the cloud.
AA Bots are open source projects in Github, programed in JavaScript. The platform calls bots and puts them to run in specific time intervals. Bots consume services from the platform and from other bots, and at the same time, produce an output that is stored in the cloud (to be consumed by other bots). There are three different types of bots:

* **AA Extraction Bots**: They extract raw trades and order books data from exchanges and store it in a standardized format for other bots to consume.

* **AA Indicator Bots**: They process raw trades data and data from other indicators to output elaborate data structures, mainly technical indicators, for AA Trading Bots to consume.

* **AA Trading Bots**: They automate trading strategies and place orders through the platform, which connects to exchanges via APIs to trade cryptocurrency. These are the bots participating in trading competitions.

The AA Platform is still under development, and its use along with registration for bots competitions are free of charge for the time being, while running on alpha testing mode. However, this is an exceptional circumstance, as the AA Platform is set to implement a business model by which end users subscribe to bots to have bots trade on their behalf, paying subscription fees to cover the costs of running the bots in the cloud and to pay Dev Teams fees. Fees will be paid in ALGO tokens, the AA Platformâ€™s native token.

Therefore, participating in early competitions not only offers you the chance to win competition prizes, but also makes you a member of the AA Community and sets you in the track to further monetize your efforts once the platform is launched to the general public.
