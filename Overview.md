There are three GitHub Organizations you need to be familiar with:

* [[Advanced Algos|https://github.com/AdvancedAlgos]]: Features repositories with the AA Platform code including the bits that run in the cloud (AACloudPlatform) and in the web browser, along with a few other platform-related tools and documentation.

* [[AAMasters|https://github.com/AAMasters]]: Its a showcase GitHub organization similar to the one each Dev Team needs to create for themselves. It features several examples of bots, each in their corresponding repository.

* [[AAArena|https://github.com/AAArena]]: Its another showcase GitHub organization featuring an AA Application hosting trading bots competitions. Dev Teams are encouraged to create their own applications and host their own competitions too.

## Setting Up a Dev Team Organization

The very first step is setting up a GitHub organization named after your own Dev Team. Make sure the name of the organization starts with “AA”, just like in the above example AAMasters. Also make sure that the phrase “Advanced Algos” is part of the organization’s description.
