There are two GitHub Organizations you need to be familiar with:

* [[Advanced Algos|https://github.com/AdvancedAlgos]]: Features repositories with the AA Platform code including the bits that run in the cloud (AACloudPlatform) and in the web browser, along with a few other platform-related tools and documentation.

* [[AAMasters|https://github.com/AAMasters]]: Its a showcase GitHub organization similar to the one each Dev Team needs to create for themselves. It features several examples of bots, each in their corresponding repository.
