At some point in time, your bots will be selling their output dataset for other bots to consume or their trading services for other users to subscribe. Make sure you write a compelling README file and make it available in the root of your bots' repositories. Please follow the examples in the bots available at the [[AAMasters Organization|https://github.com/AAMasters]]
